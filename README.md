## Overview

The Hive Platform enables users to upload, transcode, and stream video content efficiently. With its modular architecture, the platform ensures high performance and adaptability for modern video streaming needs.  

---

## Components

### 1. Hive-Watch
**Purpose:**  
Frontend for video streaming.  
**Features:**
- Uses Shaka player for smooth playback.
- Streams transcoded videos to end-users.
- Provides adaptive bitrate streaming for optimal viewing.
- Offers a user-friendly interface for playback controls.

**Technology Stack:**
- React/Next.js
- HLS.js for video playback
- Tailwind CSS for UI

### 2. Hive-Server
**Purpose:**  
Backend server managing API requests and coordinating tasks between components.  
**Features:**
- Handles user authentication and authorization.
- Serves as the bridge between the frontend and the transcoder.
- Provides APIs for video metadata and playback URLs.

**Technology Stack:**
- Python with Flask
- Supabase's PostgreSQL 
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates

### 3. Hive-Studio
**Purpose:**  
Content management studio for video uploads and administration.  
**Features:**
- User-friendly interface for uploading videos.
- Video metadata management (title, description, tags, etc.).
- Dashboard for monitoring transcoding progress and video status.

**Technology Stack:**
- React/Vite
- Styled Components
- Formik for forms and Yup for validation

### 4. Hive-Transcoder
**Purpose:**  
Dedicated server for video processing and transcoding.  
**Features:**
- Converts uploaded videos into multiple resolutions and formats.
- Supports HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) generation and DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Bitrate Streaming).
- Manages queue-based transcoding tasks for efficiency.

**Technology Stack:**
- FFmpeg for transcoding
- Sharp for image compression
- Node.js for task orchestration
- Redis for job queue management
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates from Supabase

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16+)
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized setup)
- **Supabase**
- **Redis** (for transcoding queue)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/hive-platform.git
   cd hive-platform
   ```

2. Install dependencies for each component:
   ```bash
   cd Hive-Watch && npm install
   cd ../Hive-Server && npm install
   cd ../Hive-Studio && npm install
   cd ../Hive-Transcoder && npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` files from each component to `.env`.
   - Configure variables like `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, and `TRANSCODER_API`.

4. Start components locally:
   ```bash
   # Start Hive-Server
   cd Hive-Server && python index.py
   
   # Start Hive-Watch
   cd ../Hive-Watch && npm run dev
   
   # Start Hive-Studio
   cd ../Hive-Studio && npm run dev
   
   # Start Hive-Transcoder
   cd ../Hive-Transcoder && npm run start
   ```

## Architecture

The Hive Platform follows a modular architecture:

1. **Frontend-Backend Separation:**
   - `Hive-Watch` and `Hive-Studio` are client-facing applications.
   - `Hive-Server` acts as the API layer.

2. **Distributed Processing:**
   - `Hive-Transcoder` handles CPU-intensive tasks, ensuring frontend responsiveness.

3. **Data Flow:**
   - Videos uploaded via `Hive-Studio` are processed by `Hive-Transcoder`.
   - Processed videos are served by `Hive-Watch`.

---

## Development

### Testing
Run unit tests:
```bash
npm run test
```

### Linting
Ensure code quality:
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Building for Production
Build all components:
```bash
npm run build
```
